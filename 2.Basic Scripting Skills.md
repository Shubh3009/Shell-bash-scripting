# Day2 - Basic Scripting Skills
# **📝 Bash Comments**

## **✅ SINGLE-LINE COMMENT**

### **Syntax:**
```bash
# Your comment here
```

### **Usage:**
```bash
# This is a full line comment
echo "Hello"  # This is an inline comment
# echo "This won't run"
```

### **Key Points:**
- Starts with `#`
- Ends at line end
- Can be anywhere on line
- **Ignored by shell completely**

## **✅ MULTI-LINE COMMENT**

### **Method 1: Multiple Single Lines (Most Common)**
```bash
# Line 1 of comment
# Line 2 of comment
# Line 3 of comment
```

### **Method 2: Heredoc Trick (Block Comment)**
```bash
: << 'COMMENT'
This is a 
multi-line
comment block
COMMENT
```

**Or shorter:**
```bash
<< 'COMMENT' 2>/dev/null
Multi-line text
COMMENT
```

### **Method 3: Function Never Called**
```bash
__comment() {
    This is a 
    multi-line comment
    inside unused function
}
```


### **Wrong:**
```bash
<< COMMENT
echo "This might still execute!"
COMMENT
# Missing command before <<
```

### **Right:**
```bash
: << 'COMMENT'
echo "This won't execute"
COMMENT
```
